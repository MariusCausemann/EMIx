### Supplementary material 

In this directory the four benchmark problems in "Scalable approximation and solvers for ionic electrodiffusion in cellular geometries" (2024), can be run.

## Run with
```
mpirun -n 4 python3 -u model_A.py 
```

The level of output can be controlled with 
```
save_xdmf_files = True/False
save_png_files  = True/False
```

## Geometries 
Please contact the developers for Model B,D, and C geometries
